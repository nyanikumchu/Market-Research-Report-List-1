<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fish Vaccination Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Injection-based Machines</li><li>Immersion-based Machines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fish vaccination machine market is primarily divided into two main types: injection-based machines and immersion-based machines. Injection-based machines deliver vaccines directly into individual fish, providing precise dosages and reducing vaccine waste. In contrast, immersion-based machines involve placing fish in a vaccine solution, allowing them to absorb the vaccine through their skin and gills, which is efficient for larger groups. Both types cater to different operational needs, enhancing fish health and optimizing aquaculture production.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Glaucoma Treatment Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Glaucoma Drainage Devices</li><li>Glaucoma Laser Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The glaucoma treatment devices market comprises primarily two types: glaucoma drainage devices and glaucoma laser devices. Glaucoma drainage devices are surgical implants designed to enhance aqueous humor outflow, thereby lowering intraocular pressure. These include plates or tubes that facilitate fluid drainage from the anterior chamber. On the other hand, glaucoma laser devices utilize lasers to create openings in the eye's drainage system or reduce fluid production, offering a non-invasive option for pressure management. Both types are essential for effective glaucoma management.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Patient Temperature Monitoring System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-invasive Temperature Monitoring</li><li>Invasive Temperature Monitoring</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Patient Temperature Monitoring System market is divided into two primary types: non-invasive and invasive temperature monitoring. Non-invasive temperature monitoring utilizes external methods, such as infrared thermometers and tympanic thermometers, to measure body temperature without penetrating the skin. In contrast, invasive temperature monitoring involves inserting devices, like thermocouples or thermistors, directly into the body, providing precise internal temperature readings. Both methods are essential for effective patient management, ensuring accurate temperature assessments in clinical and home care settings.</p></p>

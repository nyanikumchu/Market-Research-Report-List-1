<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radiotherapy Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>External Beam Radiotherapy</li><li>Internal Beam Radiotherapy</li><li>Systemic Radiotherapy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The radiotherapy machines market consists of three primary types: External Beam Radiotherapy (EBRT), Internal Beam Radiotherapy (IBRT), and Systemic Radiotherapy. EBRT utilizes machines like linear accelerators to direct high-energy beams at tumors from outside the body. IBRT, also known as brachytherapy, involves placing radioactive sources directly inside or near the tumor. Systemic Radiotherapy delivers radioactive substances through the bloodstream, targeting cancer cells throughout the body. Each modality offers unique advantages for patient-specific treatment plans.</p></p>

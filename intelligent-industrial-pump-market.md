<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intelligent Industrial Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal</li><li>Positive Displacement</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Intelligent Industrial Pump Market is primarily categorized into two types: centrifugal pumps and positive displacement pumps. Centrifugal pumps use rotational energy to move fluids, making them suitable for applications requiring high flow rates and low viscosity fluids. They are commonly used in water, chemical, and food processing industries. Positive displacement pumps, on the other hand, move fluid by trapping a fixed amount and forcing it into the discharge. They are ideal for high-viscosity fluids and precise flow control, often seen in oil and gas and pharmaceutical sectors.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Adsorption Dryer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Simple Adsorption Dryer</li><li>Regenerative Adsorption Dryer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The adsorption dryer market is primarily divided into two types: simple adsorption dryers and regenerative adsorption dryers. Simple adsorption dryers use a fixed bed of adsorbent material, where moisture from the air is trapped, requiring periodic replacement or regeneration of the adsorbent. In contrast, regenerative adsorption dryers feature a dual bed system where one bed adsorbs moisture while the other is being regenerated, allowing for continuous operation and greater efficiency in moisture removal. Both types are crucial for maintaining optimal humidity levels in various industrial applications.</p></p>
